TFMUD - Text First Multi User Dungeon Engine
============================================

  * * * WORK IN PROGRESS * * *

TFMUD is a traditional text-based Multi User Dungeon (MUD) engine
that differentiates itself from MUDs that rely on pseudo-graphics
or 2D gameplay elements, but rather strives to take maximum advantage
of the text format, as the text format itself can create everything
that is needed for the utmost immersion, like a novel can do it.
Therefore, TFMUD is actually more like an interactive fiction (IF)
engine, but TFMUD has particular emphasis on interaction with the
shared multiplayer environment.

Instead of relying on traditional 2D/3D CRPG (Computer Roleplaying
Game) gameplay elements, that are often action-game oriented, TFMUD
does it with a text-based command-response format where commands
specify the intention of the player, and the engine fullfills the
intention. This means, the player does not need to micromanage
details. This is more akin to traditional in-person table-top-RPG
where players tell their intentions and the game master runs the game
mechanisms behind a screen and then tells what happens.

When compared to other MUD engines, TFMUD strives to find a perfect
abstraction level for creators to easily create highly interactive
environments, even on the fly, that results in dynamic
action-descriptions that does not bore the player, but rather immerses
the player into the world like a good novel.

With the text format and a good content creation system very
interesting worlds can be created with ease especially when the content
needs not to be tied to 2D/3D game design with grids and such. When
freed from the limitations of a 2D/3D/roguelike games, vast distances,
heights and depths can be created and covered with a few lines of text.

Features
========

 * On the fly dynamic content creation.

 * Viewpoint oriented action descriptions.

 * Save files use same syntax as the runtime object creation syntax.

 * Commands support "here-documents" for allowing editing of multiline
   action descriptions from save files with a fullscreen editor.

TODO
====

 * Tag-based "puzzle system" for dynamic descriptions and actions.

Dependencies
============

Tested on OpenBSD, no dependencies necessary.

Uses kqueue(2) by default, meaning that by default this will only
work on *BSDs and macOS.

For Linux an epoll implementation should be added, or kqueue(2)
emulation should be used.

The sources includes a poll.c which implements event.h API as an
example, that could be used on Linux, as well, but it is not tested.

Compile & Install & Run
=======================

$ ./configure ~
$ make install
